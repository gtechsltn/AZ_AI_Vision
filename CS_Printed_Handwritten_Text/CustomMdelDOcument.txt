Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a custom model for Document Intelligence in Azure using Azure Document Intelligence Studio. I'll also include links to relevant videos for each step.

### Step-by-Step Procedure

1. **Create an Azure Subscription and Resource**
   - If you don't have an Azure subscription, create one here.
   - Create a Document Intelligence resource in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint.

2. **Prepare Your Training Data**
   - Gather at least five documents of the same type for training.
   - Ensure your documents are in supported formats like PDF, JPEG, PNG, etc.

3. **Upload Training Data to Azure Blob Storage**
   - Create an Azure Storage account and a container.
   - Upload your training documents to the container.

4. **Create a Project in Document Intelligence Studio**
   - Navigate to the Document Intelligence Studio.
   - Select the **Custom extraction model** tile and click **Create a project**.
   - Provide a name and description for your project.
   - Select your Document Intelligence resource and storage account.

5. **Label Your Data**
   - In the Studio, label the fields you want to extract from your documents.
   - Use the plus (➕) button to add fields and assign values by selecting text in the document.

6. **Train Your Model**
   - Once labeling is complete, click the **Train** button.
   - Provide a unique model ID and select the type of model you want to train (template or neural).
   - Click **Train** to start the training process.

7. **Test Your Model**
   - After training, test your model by selecting it from the models list.
   - Upload a test document and click **Analyze** to see the extracted fields.

8. **Deploy and Use Your Model**
   - Use the REST API or SDK to integrate your trained model into your applications.
